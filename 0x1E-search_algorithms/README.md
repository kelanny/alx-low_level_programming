PROJECT: 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms
C, Algorithm
Project will start Jan 15, 2024 6:00 AM, must end by Jan 18, 2024 6:00 AM

Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General
What is a search algorithm
What is a linear search
What is a binary search
What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs

Requirements
General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You are not allowed to use global variables
No more than 5 functions per file
You are only allowed to use the printf function of the standard library. Any call to another function like strdup, malloc, … is forbidden.
In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called search_algos.h
Don’t forget to push your header file
All your header files should be include guarded
More Info
You will be asked to write files containing big O notations. Please use this format:

O(1)
O(n)
O(n!)
n*m -> O(nm)
n square -> O(n^2)
sqrt n -> O(sqrt(n))
log(n) -> O(log(n))
n * log(n) -> O(nlog(n))
…
Tasks

TASK: 0. Linear search
mandatory
Write a function that searches for a value in an array of integers using the Linear search algorithm

Prototype : int linear_search(int *array, size_t size, int value);
Where array is a pointer to the first element of the array to search in
size is the number of elements in array
And value is the value to search for
Your function must return the first index where value is located
If value is not present in array or if array is NULL, your function must return -1
Every time you compare a value in the array to the value you are searching, you have to print this value (see example below)


TASK: 1. Binary search
mandatory
Write a function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Binary search algorithm

Prototype : int binary_search(int *array, size_t size, int value);
Where array is a pointer to the first element of the array to search in
size is the number of elements in array
And value is the value to search for
Your function must return the index where value is located
You can assume that array will be sorted in ascending order
You can assume that value won’t appear more than once in array
If value is not present in array or if array is NULL, your function must return -1
You must print the array being searched every time it changes. (e.g. at the beginning and when you search a subarray) (See example)

TASK: 2. Big O #0
mandatory
What is the time complexity (worst case) of a linear search in an array of size n?

TASK: 3. Big O #1
mandatory
What is the space complexity (worst case) of an iterative linear search algorithm in an array of size n?

TASK: 4. Big O #2
mandatory
What is the time complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n?

TASK: 5. Big O #3
mandatory
What is the space complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n?

TASK: #include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "search_algos.h"

/**
 * main - Entry point
 *
 * Return: Always EXIT_SUCCESS
 */
int main(void)
{
    int array[] = {
        0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
    };
    size_t size = sizeof(array) / sizeof(array[0]);

    printf("Found %d at index: %d\n\n", 6, jump_search(array, size, 6));
    printf("Found %d at index: %d\n\n", 1, jump_search(array, size, 1));
    printf("Found %d at index: %d\n", 999, jump_search(array, size, 999));
    return (EXIT_SUCCESS);
}

TASK: 7. Jump search
#advanced
Write a function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Jump search algorithm

Prototype : int jump_search(int *array, size_t size, int value);
Where array is a pointer to the first element of the array to search in
size is the number of elements in array
And value is the value to search for
Your function must return the first index where value is located
You can assume that array will be sorted in ascending order
If value is not present in array or if array is NULL, your function must return -1
You have to use the square root of the size of the array as the jump step.
You can use the sqrt() function included in <math.h> (don’t forget to compile with -lm)
Every time you compare a value in the array to the value you are searching for, you have to print this value (see example)

TASK: 8. Big O #5
#advanced
What is the time complexity (average case) of a jump search in an array of size n, using step = sqrt(n)?
